Derek SunBug-ReportsThe first bug found in my teammates code was found using my unittest1 file which tested the card effect for the Village card. I found that the number of actions added and number of cards drawn through the card effect were incorrect. The expected number of actions the card effect returned was 6 when the expected number of actions was 3, meaning there were 3 additional actions added to the correct amount of actions given by the card effect (2). Therefore, we know that the card effect gives 5 actions when the correct amount should be 2. The number of cards in the hand after using the effect is supposed to be 5, but the hand count after using the card returned 4. This tells us that the Village card is not drawing a card like it is supposed to.The second bug I found in my teammates code was with the Smithy card effect using my unittest2 file. The Smithy card effect is supposed to add 3 cards to the players hand. Running the unittest, the player is expected to have 5 cards in his hand after playing the card, but when getting the player’s hand count value, it is actually 6 cards. This shows that the Smithy card effect is making the player draw one card too many. The card effect was changed to add 4 cards to the player’s hand instead of the expected 3. Looking into my teammates code, we can see that the for loop for drawing cards adds 4 cards into the hand instead of 3. The for loop needs to be changed to the value 3 in order to be correct.Looking through my teammates code, I can see that the Salvager card will produce a bug because it does not gain the amount of gold of the amount of discarded card.
